## Motivation

Imagine going to a mall and getting lost in the maze of shops. If an augmented reality app could guide users to their destination using the shortest path, it could save users from a lot of hassle and save time.

This app can also be used when exploring unknown places or trekking so that a path can be traced back to the source.



### Applications


#### Malls & Airports
At the entrance, the user will be shown a list of all the shops. Once a destination is selected, a stored AR path is shown.
This service can be made available to a selected number of shops who are paid members.
A subscription model can be implemented for businesses if they wish to stay on the app.

#### Promoted Businesses
Businesses who would like to be promoted can have their places suggested when the app is being used for navigation. This will need to be as unintrusive as possible.

#### Integration with Maps
Once the destination is close enough, Google Maps does not provide the best user experience. In that case an indoor AR application seems more suited to the cause.

## APP WORKING

* Once you open the app, you would be asked to scan your environment
* After the scanning is done,  you would have to enter your destination.
* After you've typed your destination, click on the next button
* Next, you would be shown a NAV image by the application itself. This NAV image would be within 10-15m from where you are standing. You would have to go there and scan that image so as to find your accurate location.
* Once all this is done, the application would navigate you to your destination


## Status of the Project

#### What Works
- Detection of real world planes using ARCore
- Placement of markers that will be used to mark the path to be used
- Storing of paths to be used at a later time
- Guiding the user 

####  Future Work

* While your navigating to your destination , the shops that have  paid for promotion would be popped up on the screen and if the user wants, he can go there.
* Next, we have a few interactive cartoons which would guide you to your destination, to avoid confusion.
* Voice command is included for ease of use.
